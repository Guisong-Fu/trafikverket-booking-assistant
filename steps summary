All steps summary:

This is a great, very complete walk-through of the core happy-path. You’ve shown:
	•	post-login landing (“Boka prov”)
	•	choosing license category (e.g. B – Personbil)
	•	selecting test type (Körprov vs Teoriprov)
	•	if Körprov, choosing car type (Manuell/Automat); if Teoriprov, choosing exam language
	•	picking up to four test-centers by name or by typing a prefix
	•	confirming each centre and closing the picker
	•	viewing available time-slots (sorted ascending)
	•	(optionally) peeking at the calendar overview
	•	adding a slot to the “cart” and proceeding to checkout

That’s enough to draft both the user-facing LangChain dialogue and the Browser-Use action sequence. You might later want to show:
	•	what happens if no slots are found
	•	how to go “Back” or change a previous choice
	•	error or timeout messaging

But for now, here’s the full happy-path broken out step by step:

⸻

1. Authentication
	1.	User navigates to trafikverket’s test-booking page.
	2.	User logs in via their e-ID or BankID.
	3.	On success, they land on the “Välkommen” dashboard.

2. Start Booking
	1.	Bot clicks Boka prov.

3. Choose License Category
	1.	On the “Välj behörighet” screen, click the card for the desired license class (e.g. B – Personbil).

4. Specify Test Type
	1.	On the “Välj prov” dropdown, choose either Körprov (driving) or Teoriprov (theory).

5. Driving- vs Theory-specific Option
	•	If Körprov:
	1.	On “Välj bil att hyra…” dropdown choose Manuell bil or Automat.
	•	If Teoriprov:
	1.	On “Välj språk” dropdown choose exam language (Svenska, English, etc.).

6. Select Test-Center Location(s)
	1.	Click Välj provort to open the modal.
	2.	(Optional) Type the first few letters of the town (“Upps…”) to filter the list.
	3.	Click a result (e.g. Uppsala). A ✔️ appears and it counts toward “1/4”.
	4.	Repeat up to four times if the user wants backup locations.
	5.	Click Bekräfta to close the modal.

7. (Optional) Calendar Overview
	•	A calendar highlights days with any availability, but it’s not strictly required to pick.

8. Retrieve & Display Slots
	1.	The page shows a chronological list of all matching slots (date, time, place, price).
	2.	If none are found, the list is empty (your bot should detect “no results”).

9. Choose & Add to Cart
	1.	Click Välj on the desired time-slot.
	2.	A small “Varukorg” drawer appears, showing the reserved slot and a 15-minute timer.

10. Proceed to Payment or Cancel
	1.	Click Gå vidare to move on to payment.
	2.	Or click the trash icon to remove the booking and start over.

Let me know if you’d like me to flesh out any edge cases (e.g. “no slots found” flow, switching back a choice, handling time-outs) or if you want to proceed straight into crafting the LangChain user prompts and the Browser-Use action sequence!
