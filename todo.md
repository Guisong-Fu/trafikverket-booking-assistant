Now, there is a problem:

If I uncomment these lines, and let §run_qr_code_flow§ run only once, and if I manage to scan the first QR code right away to authenticate myself, it works with any problem.

However, if I use these lines
```
    while not st.session_state.get("auth_complete", False):
        run_qr_code_flow()
        time.sleep(1)
```
And let it refresh every second, the QR code displayed on the streamlit is indeed in sync with the one from the actual website, but if I scan the code and indeed authenticate myself, it kind of got stuck with the "authenticating phase", like what screenshot shows. And it never marks "authentication" as finished. In the meantime, the main website keeps refrehses every second, I'm not sure if that is the cause to the unfinished authentication.

Does the following code do any other actual action to the website other than just checking the QR  code? Could this be the cause?
```
            try:
                qr_element = await page.query_selector(".qrcode")

                if not qr_element:
                    # Click login button if visible
                    login_button = await page.query_selector("text=Logga in")
                    if login_button:
                        await login_button.click()
                        print("Clicked login button")
                        await page.wait_for_load_state("networkidle")
                    
                    # Click continue button if visible
                    continue_button = await page.query_selector("text=Fortsätt")
                    if continue_button:
                        await continue_button.click()
                        print("Clicked Fortsätt button")
                        await page.wait_for_load_state("networkidle")
                    
                    # Wait for QR code with longer timeout
                    await page.wait_for_selector(".qrcode", timeout=20000)
                    qr_element = await page.query_selector(".qrcode")
                
                if qr_element:
                    # Get a fresh screenshot of the QR code
                    qr_bytes = await qr_element.screenshot()
                    # todo: maybe I should double check the QR code is the same?
                    self.current_qr_base64 = base64.b64encode(qr_bytes).decode("utf-8")
```







It feels like it's all about timing -> the QR code on the streamlit app and trafik are not in sync




04-05:
1. langchain prompt needs to be revised -> no need to double check with user
2. the "authentication" flow should be thought again



1. use browser-use to do after work
    a. choose test type, location, language and etc. -> natrual language part
    b. output -> if there is such slot, do what? if no, do what?
    c. (optional): probably do screenshot as proof 
2. use an agent figure out what users want
3. Once done the operation, it should send out email for notification.
4. database


It could be reschedule -> §Mina prov§


Here is what I want to build on a very high level.
I want to use an AI tool called §browser-use§(which is offered as a python package) to automate Swedish driving license booking process, but I would need to able to extract the BankID QR code, which is used for authentication from official website, and display it on my own website. I have more or less implemented that solution in @main.py , which uses §playwright§ and extract the QR code and display it on a Flask website. However, as the next step, I want to then use §browser-user§ for the next steps, for example, clicks §boka test§ and etc. But I realized that, as per my understanding, if I call §browser-use agent§ like what I did in @main.py , the agent will start a new browser thus the authenticated session will be ignored, which is not what I want.
