what is the use of that ActionResult?
@controller.registry.action('Search the web for a specific query')
async def search_web(query: str):
	keys_to_use = ['url', 'title', 'content', 'author', 'score']
	headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {BEARER_TOKEN}'}
	async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
		response = await client.post(
			'https://asktessa.ai/api/search',
			headers=headers,
			json={'query': query},
		)

	final_results = [
		{key: source[key] for key in keys_to_use if key in source}
		for source in await response.json()['sources']
		if source['score'] >= 0.2
	]
	# print(json.dumps(final_results, indent=4))
	result_text = json.dumps(final_results, indent=4)
	print(result_text)
	return ActionResult(extracted_content=result_text, include_in_memory=True)
